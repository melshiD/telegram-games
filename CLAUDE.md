## Coding Standards

### General Rules

1. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the style of surrounding code
2. **Keep it simple** - Prefer clarity over cleverness
3. **Test everything** - All new code must have tests
4. **No dead code** - Remove unused imports, variables, functions

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `kebab-case.ts`
- **Components/Classes**: `PascalCase`
- **Functions/Variables**: `camelCase`
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Test files**: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`

### Code Organization

- Keep files under 300 lines
- One component/class per file
- Group related functionality in directories
- Export public API from index files

---

## Git Workflow

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `refactor:` Code restructuring
- `test:` Test additions/changes
- `docs:` Documentation
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

### Branch Naming

- `feature/short-description`
- `fix/issue-number-description`
- `refactor/what-is-changing`

## Agent Instructions

### When Planning

- Always use Plan Mode (Shift+Tab twice) for non-trivial tasks
- Break large tasks into smaller, testable chunks
- Verify understanding before implementing

### When Coding

- Read existing code before modifying
- Run tests after changes
- Keep changes focused and minimal

### When Stuck

- Check this file for guidance
- Review similar existing code
- Ask for clarification rather than guessing
