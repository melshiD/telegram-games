## TIER 1: BUILD THIS WEEK (2-3 day builds, strongest demand signals)

### 1. StandupLite / StandupPulse (Slack)
**Problem:** Standup bots like Geekbot charge $2.50-3/user/month. A 30-person team pays $75-90/mo for what is a scheduled DM + summary poster.
**Tool:** Slack bot that DMs 3 configurable standup questions, collects responses, posts formatted summary to a channel. Flat pricing.
**Users:** Remote-first startups and agencies, 10-100 people
**Price:** $19-29/mo FLAT per workspace (not per-user)
**Build:** 3-4 days (Slack Bolt framework)
**Distribution:** Slack App Directory, "cheap Geekbot alternative" SEO, r/remotework
**Why #1:** Every remote team needs this. Flat pricing is an instant pitch vs per-seat competitors. Slack App Directory handles distribution.

---

### 2. RestockPing (Shopify)
**Problem:** No cheap, simple "Notify Me When Back in Stock" app. Swym charges $19-99/mo and is bloated.
**Tool:** Adds a "Notify Me" button to out-of-stock products. Collects email. Auto-sends one email when restocked. Dashboard shows subscribers per product.
**Users:** Shopify merchants with 1-50 products
**Price:** $5-12/mo
**Build:** 3 days
**Distribution:** Shopify App Store (best distribution channel in SaaS)
**Why:** Proven evergreen need. Undercutting Swym at $5/mo is a classic wedge.

---

### 3. Simple Changelog Page (Web)
**Problem:** Indie devs need a public "What's New" page. Beamer costs $49/mo, Headway $29/mo. Absurd for solo devs.
**Tool:** Simple web app: create changelog entries, get a hosted page at yourapp.changelog.site. Optional embeddable widget + email notifications.
**Users:** Indie hackers, solo SaaS developers

**Build:** 2 days
**Distribution:** r/SaaS, r/SideProject, Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, Hacker News

### 4. OOOBot (Slack)

**Users:** Small companies (10-30 people) without HRIS
**Price:** $19/mo flat
**Build:** 3 days
**Distribution:** Slack App Directory, r/remotework, small biz communities

---

### 5. SlotBot (Discord)

**Distribution:** top.gg, Discord bot listings, r/discordapp

---

### 6. Privacy Policy / ToS Generator (Web)
**Problem:** Every new website/app needs these. Lawyers charge $500+. Monthly SaaS tools feel extractive for a static document.

**Users:** SaaS founders, app devs, Shopify store owners
**Price:** $29 one-time (lifetime updates)
**Build:** 3 days
**Distribution:** r/SaaS, r/WebDev, r/Shopify, SEO ("privacy policy generator")

---

### 7. TeleScheduler / QueueGram (Telegram)

**Price:** $9-12/mo
**Build:** 3 days

**Users:** Solo freelancers (50M+ globally)

## STRATEGIC PRIORITIES

### Key insight: Platform-embedded > Standalone
Tools inside Telegram, Discord, Shopify, Slack, Chrome always outperform standalone apps because:
- Users already exist there
- Friction is lower
- Discovery happens inside the platform
- Viral loops are built-in

### Recommended build order (first 30 days):
**Week 1:** StandupLite (Slack) + RestockPing (Shopify) -- both 3-day builds
**Week 2:** OOOBot (Slack) + SlotBot (Discord) -- both 2-3 day builds
**Week 3:** GateBot (Telegram) + Changelog Page (web) -- both 3 day builds
**Week 4:** Testimonial Wall (web) + Review Request Automator (web) -- both 3 day builds

### Revenue projection (conservative):
- 8 tools x 20 customers avg x $12/mo avg = $1,920/mo within 3-6 months
- Scale to 50 customers each = $4,800/mo
- Add 10 more tools over next 2 months = portfolio of 18 tools
- Target: $5,000-10,000/mo within 6 months from a portfolio of tiny tools

### 48-Hour Validation Checklist (for any shortlisted opportunity):
1. Search Reddit for exact pain phrases in the target subreddit. Count posts in last 12 months.
2. Count competitors: 0 = market may not exist. 3+ = validated but need differentiation. Sweet spot: 1-2 overpriced/over-featured.
3. Post a "would you pay for this?" thread in the target subreddit with a landing page link.
4. Build a landing page with waitlist (30 min).
5. Threshold: 50+ waitlist signups in 48 hours = build it. <10 = move on.
6. Pre-sell: offer lifetime deal at discount before building. 5+ buyers = validated.
